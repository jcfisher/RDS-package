\Abstract{
		Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a network sampling method used to collect data from hard to reach or hidden populations.  This paper presents the \proglang{Stata} package \pkg{RDS2} for the calculation of estimates and confidence intervals from samples generated by RDS.  \pkg{RDS2} improves on a previous RDS package for \proglang{Stata} by using more recent RDS estimates suggested by \citet{vh2008}, and a bootstrapping method more suited for network samples \citep{salganik2006}.

\section[Introduction]{Introduction}
Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) has become an increasingly popular sampling method in public health and the social sciences. RDS is a chain-referral sampling method used to estimate population sizes and collect samples in situations where it is difficult to construct a sampling frame.  In particular, RDS is commonly used to sample hard to reach populations, like injecting drug users or sex workers, or hidden populations like jazz musicians \citep{heckathorn97}.

Despite the extensive use of RDS in public health applications, few software tools exist to analyze data collected from samples gathered using RDS.  A stand-alone tool, the RDS analysis tool (RDSAT) \citep{rdsat} calculates population estimates and standard errors from RDS samples, but does not do so from within commonly used statistical software packages.  An \proglang{R} package \pkg{RDS} \citep{r-rds} exists, but its functionality is limited to point estimates.  Similarly, a \proglang{Stata} package RDS \citep{stata-rds} exists, but it does not include the most commonly used estimator for RDS samples, the \citet{vh2008} estimator, nor does it include new methods for constructing bootstrap samples, presented by \citet{salganik2006}, which take into account the chain-referral nature of the data.

In this paper, we present the \proglang{Stata} package \pkg{RDS2} which allows users to compute RDS estimates and standard errors from within \proglang{Stata}.  \pkg{RDS2} builds on the previous RDS package for \proglang{Stata} by incorporating the \citet{vh2008} estimator, currently the most commonly used RDS estimator, and the \citet{salganik2006} bootstrapping method, which takes into account the chain-referral nature of the data.  This package is distributed through xxxx.  The key function is xxxx which xxxx.  We illustrate the use of this function with previously published data (cite Giovanna) on sex workers from Liuzhou, China.  The data are contained in the file xxxx which is included with the \pkg{RDS2} package.

\section[Methodology]{Methodology}
In RDS, the sample begins with several ``seed" individuals.  Each individual is given a fixed number of coupons, usually 2 or 3, which they distribute to other individuals who they know and who are also part of the population of interest.  The individuals who receive coupons are invited to participate in the survey.  If they participate, then they are given coupons to distribute to other individuals in the population of interest.  The process is repeated until the desired sample size is achieved.  When the desired sample size is reached, individuals are no longer given coupons to distribute, terminating data collection.
